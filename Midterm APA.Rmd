# Methods
Parents learned to sing one of the two songs. They sang that song to their infants on a regular basis. After 1 to 2 weeks of song exposure, the infants returned to the lab for a selective-attention test. Finally, the parents were recorded as they sang to their infants so that expert raters could judge their pitch accuracy. 

## Participants
There were 38 full-term infants and their parents from the greater Boston area. 

## Procedure
For 1 to 2 weeks, 5-month-old infants listened at home to one of two novel songs with identical lyrics and rhythms, but different melodies; the song was sung by a parent, emanated from a toy, or was sung live by a friendly but unfamiliar adult first in person and subsequently via interactive video. We then tested the infantsâ€™ selective attention to two novel individuals after one sang the familiar song and the other sang the unfamiliar song.

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("bib.bib")` for all our analyses.


# Results

```{r, comment="Experiment 1: Baseline"}
library(data.table)
all_data <- fread("DataMehr.csv")
keep<- c() 
#all_data<- data.frame(keep)
library(dplyr)

baseline<- all_data %>%
  filter(Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer, exp1==1)

baseline<-baseline$Baseline_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer

mean_exp1<- mean(baseline)  
SD_exp1<- sd(baseline)

exp1T<-t.test(baseline, mu=.5)


```
In the baseline condition, there was no difference in gazes to singer. The mean looking time was `mean_exp1 * 100`% which was not significantly different from the expected 50% according to the one sample T-Test `exp1T$statistic`. `r apa_t.test$exp1T$`


```{r, comment = "Experiment 2: Test Phase"}
testing<- all_data %>%
  filter(Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer, exp1==1)
test<-testing$Test_Proportion_Gaze_to_Singer

mean_test<- mean(test)
SD_test<- sd(test)

expTest<- t.test(test, mu=.5)

```


```{r, comment = "Paired Samples T-Test"}
t.test(baseline,test,paired = TRUE, var.equal = TRUE)
